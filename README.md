## Final Project: Bay Area Bike Share Analysis

---
### Installing

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)

### Code

Some code is provided by Udacity. Udacity students are asked to implement some additional functionalities.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Bay-Area-Bike-Share/` (that contains this README) and run the following command:

```jupyter notebook analisebayarea.ipynb```  

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

Data is split among twelve other files, organized into three sets of four files
each. Prefixing each set is one of three datestamps, showing the end month for
each data collection period (201402, 201408, 201508). Suffixes for each file
indicate contents:

\*\_README.txt - Information about contents of data files.

\*\_station\_data.csv - Basic information about station locations and
capacities.

\*\_trip\_data.csv - Information about each trip taken using the bike share
system.

\*\_weather\_data.csv - Weather information by day for one station in each
city in the bike share program.
